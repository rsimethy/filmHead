			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		    <div id="center">
			<p><b>Is this C-41 processing? </b></p>
			<p>No, this film is specifically made for ECN-2 film processing. Please do not send this film to just any film lab. They will either reject your film or 
				accidentally process the roll and it will not only ruin the photos, but it will also ruin their chemicals. </p>
				<br> <br> <br>
			<p><b>What does the 250 and 50 mean? </b></p>
			<p>This is your film speed or ISO. This means that your camera settings relating to exposure should match this number to properly 
				expose your film with the most consistency. However, this film has a wide range which makes it a good film to pick to handle a variety of lighting conditions. 
				Also, the lower the number for ISO the less film grain you are getting. If you are using a
				 point and shoot camera, the camera will know how to expose the film.</p>
				 <br> <br> <br>
		    <p><b>Where do I get this film processed? </b></p>
			<p>Make sure to find a lab that has ECN-2 processing, not every standard film lab will have this. (lab name examples that Seb would like to include will be inserted here) </p>
			<br> <br> <br>
			<p><b>What payment do you accept? </b></p>
			<p>We use Stripe to handle all of our transactions - Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Discover, JCB, Diners Club, China UnionPay, and debit cards.</p>
			<br> <br> <br>
			<p><b>How many pictures can I take with 1 roll? </b></p>
			<p>Each of our 35mm rolls are able to take 36 pictures (exposures) and sometimes you can get lucky with 1 or 2 extra shots depending on how you load your film camera.</p>
			<br> <br> <br>
			<p><b>How long will it take to ship out my order? </b></p>
			<p>Once your payment has been processed, it will take 1-3 days to ship out.(Only for USA based shipping)</p>
